# Horde3D fork

I am working on :

#### vec4 vertex colors
xyz : rgb color adjustment
w : minimum shadow at vertex level

allow for multiple instances of a model with different vertex color
-> save and load these

#### static / dynamic objects VS shadow rendering

#### exposing mesh rendering queues
goal is to manage the queues to limit state changes
easier with contextual information - in the world - than from the library
